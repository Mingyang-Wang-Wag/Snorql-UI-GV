# NOTE: deliberately no VOLUME for /usr/local/apache2/htdocs here — Docker/Compose
# preserves an existing anonymous volume's contents across container recreation,
# which silently shadows anything newly added to htdocs by this Dockerfile (bit
# us with sd.ttl and .well-known/void going stale after a rebuild). Nothing here
# needs htdocs to persist across recreations: script.sh regenerates its sed edits
# on every start, and .well-known/void is republished by the data-load scripts.
